# JSPrintManager App I18N/Localization

## Overview
The JSPrintManager App uses the following JSON files for UI locatization. They are open for any native speakers to fix and improve any of them (in the initial state some files were automatically translated and could contain errors) and the addition of any missing language is appreciated.

**IMPORTANT!** 
Some of the entries of the JSON file could contain an English text between square brackets like **[PORT]** which **must not be localized**
